Ingredients

    Olive oil
    2 cloves of garlic
    1 medium onion
    1 lb of ground beef (about 500 g)
    Salt
    Pepper
    Cumin
    Chili powder or hot paprika
    Cinnamon
    ½ cup of green olives
    ⅓ cup of walnuts
    ⅓ cup of raisins
    1 hard boiled egg
    1 raw egg yolk
    Pre-made dough or pie crust

Instructions

    Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).
    Chop the walnuts and toast them in the oven until golden brown.
    Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.
    Chop the garlic and onion, and add them to the pan.
    Sauté until the garlic and onion are soft and aromatic.
    Add the ground beef to the pan and season generously with the spices.
    Sauté until the beef is cooked through (don't overcook!).
    Chop the olives and egg into small pieces.
    Mix the toasted walnuts, olives, egg, and raisins into the beef.
    Taste and add more salt, pepper, and spices as necessary.
    Cut the dough into discs approximately 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.
    One by one, place a spoonful of the beef mixture in the center of each disc.
    Wet your fingers with water and dab it onto the perimeter of the disc (to help it stick).
    Fold the disc in half with the beef inside, and press the outside edges together to close it.
    Fold or press the edge of the disc into the desired design.
    Place the empanadas on a large baking tray or cookie rack, lined with parchment paper.
    Beat the egg yolk in a small bowl, then brush a light coating onto the outside of each empanada.
    Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the dough turns a light golden brown.
    Let cool before serving (I've learned this the hard way)!
