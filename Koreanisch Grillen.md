Bulgogi I 
==========

    Thinly slice 1 pound of sirloin or tenderloin beef against the grain.
    Mix these ingredients to make a marinade:
    1/4 Nashi-Birne
        2 tbs of soy sauce
        3 tbs of water
        1 tbs of brown sugar
        1 tbs of honey
        1 tbs of sesame oil
        1 tbs of toasted sesame seeds
        2 chopped green onions
        4 cloves of minced garlic
        ½ ts of black pepper.
    Add the beef to the marinade and keep in the fridge at least 30 minutes. If your cut of beef is tough, you can marinate longer to soften it, or use a Korean pear in the marinade, like I do in this recipe.
    Cook it on a pan or a grill, and transfer to a plate or a cast iron plate to serve.
    Sprinkle chopped green onion and toasted sesame seeds over top.
    Wrap a piece of bulgogi in a lettuce left with a little bit of ssamjang, and put it in your mouth. You can dip carrot or cucumber strips into the ssamjang.
